# Real World Kul Elnas 

Not very funny, right? It's only entertaining when it's a cartoon. 

How about American citizens stop trying to traffick all these 
Kul Elna foreigners (Mexico,China,Vietnam,Eastern Europe) into the country? 
That would definitely help prevent Kul Elnas. Less cause to point fingers and 
cry foul at. 

Kul Elna is a fictional village featured in Yu-Gi-Oh's Season 5. Bakura, the 
only survivor from the village of Kul Elna that was deemed the darkest criminal 
spot in the ghettos surrounding Cairo, does not seem to me to be of fully Arabic descent. 
Kul Elna is based on the Thebani necropolis, a destitute and barren region for the dead 
to enjoy themselves in peace. Bakura and his fellow villagers of Kul Elna are most likely 
Semitic or of Ptolemaic Greek progeny. Bakura has light-colored hair, something not derived 
from the Orient, and the few blondes in the Middle East are most likely products of the sex 
and slave trade. Kul Elna was chosen for sacrifice due to ethnic differences, I believe. 
Perhaps the villagers really were that evil from the context of human judgment. But the 
power dynamics in labor-intensive societies usually spare officials, at least from harm by the 
state. Kul Elna was chosen. It was a time where Egyptian elites were waging "shadow games" 
with each other. Kul Elna was like an item for their arsenal of weaponry to continue on 
shadow-gaming.
