# Real World Kul Elnas 

Not very funny, right? It's only entertaining when it's a cartoon. 

How about American citizens stop trying to traffick all these 
Kul Elna foreigners (Mexico,China,Vietnam,Eastern Europe) into the country? 
That would definitely help prevent Kul Elnas. Less cause to point fingers and 
cry foul at. 

Kul Elna is a fictional village featured in Yu-Gi-Oh's Season 5. Bakura, the 
only survivor from the village of Kul Elna that was deemed the darkest criminal 
spot in the ghettos surrounding Cairo, does not seem to me to be of fully Arabic descent. 
Kul Elna is based on the Thebani necropolis, a destitute and barren region for the dead 
to enjoy themselves in peace. Bakura and his fellow villagers of Kul Elna are most likely 
Semitic or of Ptolemaic Greek progeny. Bakura has light-colored hair, something not derived 
from the Orient, and the few blondes in the Middle East are most likely products of the sex 
and slave trade. Kul Elna was chosen for sacrifice due to ethnic differences, I believe. 
Perhaps the villagers really were that evil from the context of human judgment. But the 
power dynamics in labor-intensive societies usually spare officials, at least from harm by the 
state. Kul Elna was chosen. It was a time where Egyptian elites were waging "shadow games" 
with each other. Kul Elna was like an item for their arsenal of weaponry to continue on 
shadow-gaming. 

Maybe it is too much to ask for anything other than an idyllic environment, and that can be 
found in Charlotte County. But there is a world outside not explored yet by me. Certain parts 
of the Orient have hit the bottom of my list in the past 5 years. And there must be valid cause 
for my blind eye to these certain peoples.

The slums. Most people prefer not to live in them, given other options legally or illegally 
attainable. What did the village of Kul Elna do for a living? How did the village get founded? 
Would Kul Elna villagers not have preferred the luxuries offered by the Cairo Metropolis? Was 
Kul Elna tied to the land in the same way daytime Egyptian laborers had to worship the sun, whether 
through choice or experience? 

Kul Elna begs the question of if people are sometimes born into sin. The answer is yes, from my perspective. 
But I am stopping short of stating that that guarantees eternal damnation. I believe that wanting for an 
idyllic life is also sinful, from the basis of sloth. Sloth, being a sin, falls in the bottom half 
of the Seven Deadly Sins. So here is a question, if a sin is a sin, why not always choose #1?

The monster conjured by Bakura, through the dark passions from spiritual vengeance, is called the Diabound 
Kernel. Its base form is that of a grey statuesque winged anthromorphic human with a serpent for the lower 
half. A common pose of the serpent is in a circular formation, signifying the karmic-derived idea of Ouroboros. 
Behind the aesthetics of the Ouroboros lie millennia of civil wars, betrayals, and factionalism that serve as 
psychological support for the acceptance of the Ouroboros solution, a solution that tends to be presented as 
the light of purification by its supporters. Bakura, after escaping the Kul Elna massacre, waged a kleptocratic 
campaign with fellow horsemen. In the couple of years leading up to Bakura's invasion, the Egyptian capital was 
disconnected in military coordination and government campaigns were not planned out in settings of full consultation. 
There was evidence of factionalism and little shared acknowledgment between leaders on these matters. Bakura was 
able to storm in what appears to be a straight and rapid path right into the palace of the young Pharaoh that 
took over rule after the passing of his father. There is this theme of contested thrones and evil seconds ( 
jealous right-hand men, subordinate uncles, et cetera). The small group of elites serving the Pharaoh also have monsters 
of their own. Despite the lack of official status, the Diabound Kernel is able to defeat these Egyptian elites. The 
Diabound Kernel transforms itself, via absorbing the energy of its fallen adversaries, for stronger capabilities over 
the course of its existence, shortly but surely rivalling the greatest god monsters by the Pharaoh himself. The plotline 
of Bakura and Diabound Kernel illuminates on the dominance of chaos when chaos seems to suddenly appear an endpoint 
to a lot of time spent by human beings with failing and malformed connections between leadership and the greater world.
