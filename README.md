# Real World Kul Elnas 

Not very funny, right? It's only entertaining when it's a cartoon. 

How about American citizens stop trying to traffick all these 
Kul Elna foreigners (Mexico,China,Vietnam,Eastern Europe) into the country? 
That would definitely help prevent Kul Elnas. Less cause to point fingers and 
cry foul at. 

Kul Elna is a fictional village featured in Yu-Gi-Oh's Season 5. Bakura, the 
only survivor from the village of Kul Elna that was deemed the darkest criminal 
spot in the ghettos surrounding Cairo, does not seem to me to be of fully Arabic descent. 
Kul Elna is based on the Thebani necropolis, a destitute and barren region for the dead 
to enjoy themselves in peace. Bakura and his fellow villagers of Kul Elna are most likely 
Semitic or of Ptolemaic Greek progeny. Bakura has light-colored hair, something not derived 
from the Orient, and the few blondes in the Middle East are most likely products of the sex 
and slave trade. Kul Elna was chosen for sacrifice due to ethnic differences, I believe. 
Perhaps the villagers really were that evil from the context of human judgment. But the 
power dynamics in labor-intensive societies usually spare officials, at least from harm by the 
state. Kul Elna was chosen. It was a time where Egyptian elites were waging "shadow games" 
with each other. Kul Elna was like an item for their arsenal of weaponry to continue on 
shadow-gaming. 

Maybe it is too much to ask for anything other than an idyllic environment, and that can be 
found in Charlotte County. But there is a world outside not explored yet by me. Certain parts 
of the Orient have hit the bottom of my list in the past 5 years. And there must be valid cause 
for my blind eye to these certain peoples.

The slums. Most people prefer not to live in them, given other options legally or illegally 
attainable. What did the village of Kul Elna do for a living? How did the village get founded? 
Would Kul Elna villagers not have preferred the luxuries offered by the Cairo Metropolis? Was 
Kul Elna tied to the land in the same way daytime Egyptian laborers had to worship the sun, whether 
through choice or experience? 

Kul Elna begs the question of if people are sometimes born into sin. The answer is yes, from my perspective. 
But I am stopping short of stating that that guarantees eternal damnation. I believe that wanting for an 
idyllic life is also sinful, from the basis of sloth. Sloth, being a sin, falls in the bottom half 
of the Seven Deadly Sins. So here is a question, if a sin is a sin, why not always choose #1?
